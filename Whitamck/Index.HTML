If you are having a hard day this is for you...
If you are struggling with anxiety I just wanted you to know you are doing the best that you can do and trust me that is ok. Never leave your house feeling like your a nobody, because even though you feel like one you are just having a hard day! (it happens to the best of us). You're going to be ok! I know everybody has some days that they're not feeling 100%, but you should NEVER feel like you don't belong in this world... because you DO!!!!You are sooooo beautiful...don't think of yourself otherwise!!! You will get through today feeling AWSOME!! no bad thoughts aloud here!
