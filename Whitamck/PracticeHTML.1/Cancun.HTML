Hello, World!

A couple of years ago, my wife and I went to <u> Cancun Mexico. </u> <br>
It was very awesome. <p>

On the beach, I decided to go <i> parasailing. </i> <br>
Parasailing is flying with a parachute behind a motorboat! <p>

The motorboat was going so <b><u> fast. </u></b> <br>
The parachute was going so <b><i> high. </i></b> <br>
<b><u><i>It was the most exciting thing I've ever done! </i></u></b> <p>

P.S. The people on the beach looked like <font size=1 color="red"> tiny little ants. </font>
