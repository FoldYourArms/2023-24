<font color=FFCC00 size=4>People of the <b>Milky Way universe</b>, today we are going to talk about being <u><b>weird</u></b>. If you want to be weird, <i>you should be funny</i>, but <i><b><u>know when to stop</i></b></u>. You shouldn't be too weird. Otherwise, people might not like you. Additionally, <u><b>being too weird can create weird arguments</u></b>. But, moving on, you want to <u><b>personalize</u></b> how weird you are. You can choose how weird you want to be, so long as you are aware of what it could do. However, <u><b><i>being weird is not a bad thing</u></b></i>. It is a way to show your crazy side that not everyone sees. So, maybe try being weird for a change. Just make sure that it's <u><b>appropriate.</u></b><p>


<font size=4 color=FF6600>Now, let's talk about being <b><u>positive</b></u>. Being positive is really great! You always have good days! But, if you aren't truly posistive, you could be like a volcano waiting to erupt. So, <b><u>it's okay to be sad once in a while</b></u>. I know from experience that <b><u>it is hard to be positive each and every day</b></u>. But, there were a few books that really encouraged me to be more positive. Those books were<i><u> The Energy Bus</u>, <u>The Coffee Bean</i></u> (I think that's what it is called) and <i>more</i>! I can't remember who the arthur is of all those books, but he is really <b>inspiring</b>! I highly recommend those books I already recommended! They are life changing if you listen to them!<p></font>


<font size=4 color="red">Additionally, lets talk about life. Life is full of challenges. It seems to get harder each day. But, if you have people to help you get through it all, like friends, it becomes much easier. <b>NEVER EVER</b> kill yourself because of your life. That is not the solution. Have you ever thought who would be incredibly sad if you were to die? <u>Suicide is never the solution</u>. There are therapists in the world who can help you. There is also your family who care about you. And, I find that nature is a good way to help yourself. Finally, pets, or animals, can act like your besties. Although they don't know how to talk, they are still go listeners. :)

<font size=4 color="purple">Ok, let's now talk about <b><u>talents</b></u>. Not everyone has a mastered talent, and that's <b>TOTALLY OK</b>. It <u>takes time</u> to find a talent or thing you enjoy doing. And, as soon as you find one, <u>you'd don't have master it immediatly</u>. In fact, finding other things you like to do can be a good thing. A report I readed one time say something like, "<i>Having only one thing to do (it was talking about sports) can cause stress and unsureness. But, having more than one is better. It makes the person know more things and doesn't cause as much stress or pressure to get it right.</i>" I must say, I agree. Having only one thing you do <u><i>does</i> cause pressure</u> to get it right. It's as if you <i>have</i> to get it right since it's the only thing you are doing. So, I'd say to <u><i>find mulitple talents</u></i> to do.<p>


<font size=4 color="blue">Alrighty, let's get started. Now, we shall talk about <u><b> friends</u></b>. Good, long-lasting <u>friends are hard to find</u>. Not to mention, maintaining that friendship. However, just like there are book for being positive, there are books for how to be a great friend. <b><u>If you are a great person, others will want to be your friend</b></u>.Even though that may not be the case for some people, it doesn't mean they shouldn't be the one asking to be friends. If life isn't seeming to give you friends, <u> stop waiting</u>! Waiting will only cause pain and thoughts like "<i>I'm so stupid, no one wants to be my friend.</i>" or "<i>Why doesn't anyone want to be my friend?! Am I just that bad?</i>" Those thoughts are all mean and wrong. And, if you were thinking the last thought I mentioned, it might be the other way around. The person might want <b>you</b> to ask them to be friends. That is why, in my opinion, you should take the initiative. If you do that, you will mostly likely get (a) friends!<p>


<font size=4 color="green">Last but not least, let's talk about <b><u>school</b></u>. If you think school should have never existed, get a load of this: "<i>Now, there are some kids who hate school and wish they could not go to it. But, without school, how do you expect to make money? Without school, how do you live? You need a job to live, but education gets you jobs. So, without school, you can't have a job, house, car, or pretty much anything.</i>" Those were the words someone told me and other people during a meeting that was for student council. As funny as that was to me, there was some truth in it. Well, anywho, if you are the opposite of hating school, keep it up! <u>Liking school is a good thing, but not everyone has to live it</u>! And, if you're in the middle of hate and like, that is also not a bad thing. However, if you are on the "sad" side (as in you hate school because you get bullied or other things), you might want to try to get help. Whether that's from an adult, your principal, or even you're parents, it might help you. So, if you are struggling, consider getting help, if you want it. So, school can be fun, boring, or bad. But, remember, <b><u>try to be positive</b></u>. <p></font>
