If you are not having a good day, try to remember this:<br><i> "Keep your face always toward the sunshine, and the shadows will fall behind you." â€” Walt Whitman<p></i>

I really like that quote. Do you? I find it clever and inspiring!

There are a lot of good quotes that you can find. Feeling depressed but want to feel happy? Google some positive quotes!<br>
Or, if you don't have internet available, you can get some books that are positive.<p>
For example, there are plenty of good, positive books by Jon Gordon. I found those really helpful.<p><hr color=5599CC>

<a href=http://blinkist.com><img src="My Stuff/Images/CoffeeBean.jpg"></a><br>Click on this to go to a webpage that will give you a summary of one of the books Jon Gordon wrote. Actually, I think it will read it to you or let you read it, if you prefer that. (You might have to search up <i>Coffee Bean Book Summary</i>, though, if you can).<p>
