<hr>Here is something very fascinating! DOGS CAN'T SPIT! Mr. Welch is going to fast! I love huskys! Taylor Swift is the best! My fav album by her is Reputation! Favorite song is all of the reputation ones. Lagoon is fun. World, this is my last year in elementry school. I'm sad yet exited! I can't wait for summer, it will be so much fun. I have soccer tryouts coming up. I love soccer, its the bomb! Literally. I just blew up Ukraine with it!... JK! I hope Ukraine wins the war, they probaly won't. I'M BORED! I want costa vida, panda express, swig, and much more. I so badly want to meet patrick mahomes and kiss his face! I also want to meet taylor swift and get her autograph! Ur mum is stupid. JK. idk ur mum. I like my mum. i don't like ur mum. JK..... sorry im bored. Please come take me to Maui Hawaii. Chick-fil-a is very good, we don't go there often....it makes me sad. Aubrie is also very bored. Her coding won't save. Here are some words by her-ur mom should eat taco bell because she needs to poop soon. I recomend a bean burrito. Now its me ruby! Kaylee is next to me. She says yes. I want to go home. So does kaylee, lily, aubrie, arely. And prob many mores. Cheesy dibbles! Arely is singing me a song. Its a slay song. I love huskies, malamutes, blue merel collie, bernise moutain dogs, border collies, australlian shepards, golden retrivers, and more! One of my fav drinks at swig is lifes a peach. I think taylor swift and travis kelce are going to breack up. Don''t ask why I said that. IDK... Taylor swift has left all of her old boyfriends with a broken heart. She just want the good memories. DOn't ask why I said that. IDK... My favorite food is tacos or fries. I really can't ever pick a favorite. I so badly want to go home. THis day has felt like years. This week has felt like a gerneration. And its Wednesday. Kaylle helped me spell that. </hr>
