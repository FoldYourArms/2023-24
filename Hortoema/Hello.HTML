<u>People of the milky way universe!!</u> Today we are going to talk about how to be <b><u>weird</u></b>.
</font>
<p>
<hr>
1. You have to ask the question "what is my <i>personality?"</i>
</p>
<p>
2. You have to ask the question "what are my limits when I'm being weird?" You have to have limits or people will not like you. with the effect of that you will be lonely.
</p>
<p>
 3. You have to be weird around the right people. Some people are more... serious and thats ok but when you do that it will make a really weird moment in time with your people you are being weird to.
</p>
<p>
4. You have to <b><u>personalize your weirdness,</b></u> when you are werid people dont want you coping them and thats why you want to <i>personlize.</i>
