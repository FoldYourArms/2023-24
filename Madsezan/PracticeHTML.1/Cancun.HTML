Hello, World!

A couple of years ago, my wife and I went to Cancun Mexico.
It was very awesome.

On the beach, I decided to go parasailing.
Parasailing is flying with a parachute behind a motorboat!

The motorboat was going so fast.
The parachute was going so high.
It was the most exciting thing I've ever done!

P.S. The people on the beach looked like tiny little ants.
