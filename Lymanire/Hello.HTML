how to do a toe touch on floor<p>
if you can do it on a trampoline that would help a lot
<p>
first you will start by grasping your hands together in front of you in a cone
<p>
then you will bring your hands down still together and lift them up to a t-pose
<p>
next you will keep a t-pose in the air while your legs are in a middle split in the air
<p>
now you will land in a sitting position with your hands under your thighs
<p>
lastly you will stand back up clean with your hands by your side
<p>
