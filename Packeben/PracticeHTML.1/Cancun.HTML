A couple of years ago, my wife and I went to <U>Cancun Mexico. </U><BR>
It was very awesome. <p>

On the beach, I decided to go <i> parasailing. </i> <BR>
Parasailing is flying with a parachute behind a motorboat! <P>

The motorboat was going so <b><u>fast. </u></b> <BR>
The parachute was going so <B><I>high. </B></I><BR>
<B><U><I> It was the most exciting thing I've ever done! </I></U></B> <P>

P.S. The people on the beach looked like <font size=1 color=red> tiny little ants. </font> <P>
