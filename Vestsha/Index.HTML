<p>I also love Disneyland! I basically grew up there. My family has been there soooo many times! Its so fun. One time on the ride called "Jungle Cruise" the boat went of the course and we had to wait for an hour for someone to get us! My favorite rides at Disneyland are the rollercoasters! I love them so much! I mostly like the rollercoasters "Incredicoaster" and "Space Mountain" they are so fun and crazy.
