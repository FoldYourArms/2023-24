(So far we have 52 fast food/drink places.)<hr>

<br><u>There once was a BURGER KING  who married a DAIRY QUEEN and they had a son named CARL'S JR. and a daughter named WENDY'S.<b> They had 2 jesters, one named RONALD McDONAlD and one named JACK who lived IN A BOX ( you need to get the really powwerful box sound).<p> They got married in the gorgeous OLIVE GARDEN and lived in a WHITE CASTLE with a TACO BELL hanging from the top. <p>They had the noble 5 GUYS with none other than KERNAL SANDERS as the leader, but he goes by KFC. And they had a chicken named CHICK-FA-LA. And paid in their royal STARBUCKS.<p> And they had a guardian angel named LITTLE CAESERS who lived in a PIZZA HUT and played with DOMINOS. <p>And one day an old man named PAPA JOHNS and his grandson JIMMY JOHNS came to the noble 5 asking for permission to open up a cookie shop, partnered with SEVEN BROTHERS to make CRUMBLE Cookies.<p> They used a BARREL that would hold all their CRACKERS. Then one of the owners of the cookie place had a kid named KNEADERS.<p> He met up with MAGELBY'S and made a restaurant called KRISPY KREME. Whenever they would drive up to their castle they would take the TEXAS ROAD to their HOUSE.<p> But they would get there by using the PANDA EXPRESS, Because they were too rich to take the SUBWAY.  They would have their CHUBBY baker make them their finest SEÜSS red velvet cookies.<p> They thought to themselves why have a Pizzeria when I can have a FRUITERIA too? Their family would only awaken with their DAYLIGHT DONUTS.<p> Whenever it was to CHILLIES they immediately thought of the ARTIC CIRCLE. So they went for a SWIG in their hot tub. But then they wanted breakfast for dinner so they made the waffles that they love. But the family had a tradition, they would always wish on 711.<p> But one day they needed help because WENDY was sick so they called out to the great MAMA CHUS. She said the only one who could help them cure Wendy's FIZZY stomach ache is JERSEY MIKES.<p> But not even he could do it so they went to  his brother DENNY'S he said to eat a freshly smoked SMOKING APPLE. They would have their professional chef make them burgers that would feel like they chef went IN AND OUT of the kitchen he was that fast.<p> And of course they would go swimming and only eat their WATERBURGERS.<p> But they wanted to eat CHIPOTLE BOWL every week even though it was to spicy.  But then they found there grandmother MACEY.  They had a dinner with their pirate friends who said i made some
 RRRRRRR’ and RRRRRRR’ BARBEQUE.<p> They had lots of exotic animal restaurants like the RED LOBSTER and the BLACK BEAR DINER. They would only have the richest and ripest of ORANGE JULIUS there was. They would only have their delicious SODALICIOUS soda. In wendy’s school class there a 2 JACKS</br></u>. The end We hope you enjoyed this lovely fast food story! =)
