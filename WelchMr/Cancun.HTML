A couple of years ago, my wife and I went to <u>Cancun Mexico.</u><br>
It was very awesome.<p>

On the beach, I decided to go <i>parasailing</i><br>
Parasailing is flying with a parachute behind a motorboat!<p>

The motorboat was going so <b><u>fast.</b></u><br>
The parachute was going so <b><i>high</b></i>.<br>
<b><u><i>It was the most exciting thing I've ever done!</i></u></b><p>

P.S. The people on the beach looked like <font size=1 color="red">tiny</font> little ants.
