A couple of years ago, my wife and I went to <U>Cancun Mexico</u><br>
It was very awesome.<P>

On the beach, I decided to go <i>parasailing.</i><br>
Parasailing is flying with a parachute behind a motorboat!<P>

The motorboat was going so <b><u>fast.</u></b><Br>
The parachute was going so high.<BR>
<b><u><i>It was the most exciting thing I've ever done!</b></u></i><P>

P.S. The people on the beach looked like <Font size=1 color="red">tiny little ants.</font><P>
