Q: <b> WHY IS STRING ENTERPOLIATION NAT WORKING!!!!</b>
<br> 
  <i>-Anonymous </i>
<p>
A: If you need help with string enterpoliation, try changing "-" or '-' to `-`. 
String only works if it KNOWS you want to write string.

A:If you don't know how to do something, or don't know what's wrong, try asking a AI.

3.    
Q: How do i make my code simpler?
<br>
  <i>-Emari Horton. (Orem Utah) </i>
<p>
A: First off, try finding a coding service. I use codecademy, and it gives me a lot of help when I don't know how.
<br>
    Second off, I am more lucky when it comes coding than most people, because my dad, and my brother are kind of coding dudes. If you don't know, you can always ask someone with some experience in the subject.
<br>
RESPONSE: "Is there any other places I can go for help with coding?"
<p>
FollowUp: Codecademy, freeCodeCamp, Code.org for the basics.
