A couple of years ago, my wife and I went to<u> Cancun Mexico.</u><br>
It was very awesome.<p>

On the beach, I decided to go<i> parasailing.</i><br>
Parasailing is flying with a parachute behind a motorboat!<p>

The motorboat was going so<b><u>fast.</u></b><br>
The parachute was going so<b><i>high.</i></u><br>
<b><u><i>It was the most exciting thing I've ever done!</i></u></b><p>

P.S. The people on the beach looked like<font size=1 color="red" tiny little ants.</font><p>
