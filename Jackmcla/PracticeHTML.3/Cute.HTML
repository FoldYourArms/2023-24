Hello, World!

In 2005, my wife and I had twins.<br>
They were so dang cute!<br>
Here is a picture of them...<br>

Cute, right?<p>

Here they were in 2006.<br>

Very, Very Cute!<p>

On Halloween, they dressed up like poodles.<br>

Very, Very, Very Cute!<p>

And, here they are in 2023 (with Quincey)...<br>

Still cute, in my opinion!
