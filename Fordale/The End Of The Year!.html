<font size=5 color=28f894>Today I'm gonna talk to you guys about Junior High! So Jr.High is another step in life so you are in Elementary in 1st,2nd,3rd,4th,5th,and 6th grade and after 6th grade you will go to a new school which is a Jr.High and it has alot of different things to it like it has lockers, no reccess, lots of classes, and more! But I just want to tell you to enjoy Elementary because it won't last forever so just enjoy it have fun and get good grades and be a good student because the Jr.H teachers won't be that nice but if you're a good student they'll be nice and not get mad at you so "Be Cool And Stay In School!"

P.S
I'm Alexa and I'm gonna be in O.C.Jr.H
